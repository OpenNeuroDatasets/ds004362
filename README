## Experiment Protocol
 This data set consists of over 1500 one- and two-minute EEG recordings, obtained from 109 volunteers, as described below.                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
Subjects performed different motor/imagery tasks while 64-channel EEG were recorded using the BCI2000 system (http://www.bci2000.org). Each subject performed 14 experimental runs: two one-minute baseline runs (one with eyes open, one with eyes closed), and three two-minute runs of each of the four following tasks:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
**[Task 1]** A target appears on either the left or the right side of the screen. The subject opens and closes the corresponding fist until the target disappears. Then the subject relaxes.                                                                                                                                         
**[Task 2]** A target appears on either the left or the right side of the screen. The subject imagines opening and closing the corresponding fist until the target disappears. Then the subject relaxes.                                                                                                                            
**[Task 3]** A target appears on either the top or the bottom of the screen. The subject opens and closes either both fists (if the target is on top) or both feet (if the target is on the bottom) until the target disappears. Then the subject relaxes.                                                                         
**[Task 4]** A target appears on either the top or the bottom of the screen. The subject imagines opening and closing either both fists (if the target is on top) or both feet (if the target is on the bottom) until the target disappears. Then the subject relaxes.                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
In summary, the experimental runs were:

    14. Task 4 

Each event code includes an event type indicator (T0, T1, or T2) that is concatenated to the Task # it belongs with (i.e TASK1T2). The event type indicators change definition depending on the Task # it is associated with. For example, TASK1T2 would correspond to the onset of real motion in the right fist, while TASK3T2 would correspond to onset of real motion in both feet:

**[T0]** corresponds to rest

**[T1]** corresponds to onset of motion (real or imagined) of:

- the left fist (in runs 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, and 12; for Task 1 (real) and Task 2 (imagined))
- both fists (in runs 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, and 14; for Task 3 (real) and Task 4 (imagined))

**[T2]** corresponds to onset of motion (real or imagined) of:

- the right fist (in runs 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, and 12; Task 1 (real) and Task 2 (imagined))
- both feet (in runs 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, and 14; for Task 3 (real) and Task 4 (imagined))

**Note:** The data files in this dataset were converted into the .set format for EEGLAB. The event codes in the .set files of this dataset will contain the concatenated event codes above for all event files for clarity purposes. The non-converted .edf files along with the accompanying PhysioBank-compatible annotation files for all the runs of each subject can be found in the sourcedata folder. In the non-converted .edf files the event codes will only be shown as T0, T1, and T2 regardless of task type. 

## Montage
The EEGs were recorded from 64 electrodes as per the international 10-10 system (excluding electrodes Nz, F9, F10, FT9, FT10, A1, A2, TP9, TP10, P9, and P10), as shown in the figure in the code folder. The numbers below each electrode name indicate the order in which they appear in the records; note that signals in the records are numbered from 0 to 63, while the numbers in the figure range from 1 to 64.
